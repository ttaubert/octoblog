You may already know the story of [how I became a Firefox contributor]({{ root_url }}/blog/2012/01/how-i-became-a-firefox-contributor/). Back in early April of 2011, having volunteered full-time for three months (a rather short time compared to other core contributors), I was given the opportunity to start as a paid contributor working for Mozilla.

Over the year I met a lot of great people and had the chance to visit our awesome offices in Mountain View, San Francisco and soon Toronto. I attended JSConf.eu, MozCamp and FOSDEM, with the JSDay yet to come.

But Mozilla isn’t about traveling or attending conferences. It’s about passion for open source, passion for the open web. Working for a non-profit, where decisions are driven by reason and mission, is something that not many software engineers will ever experience in their whole professional career. That’s only one of the reasons I’m really glad to be a part of the global Mozilla community.

Inspired by [Lucas Rocha](http://lucasr.org/2012/03/13/my-first-238-days-at-mozilla/) I’ll end this post with some neat statistics about my contributions to the Mozilla project (we Germans love statistics):

I fixed 223 bugs and reviewed patches for 116. I pushed 417 changesets, 110 of them being merges between trees. I changed roughly 1367 files (31862 insertions(+), 19081 deletions(-)).
