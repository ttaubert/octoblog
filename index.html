    <p>
      Over the last weeks we worked hard on getting the New Tab Page into Firefox. It’s not quite ready yet but we need your help testing it. We enabled it by default on Nightly and decided to give it a week on Aurora to get feedback from those users as well. Nightly: http://nightly.mozilla.org/

      December 2009. I’ve been a freelancer for quite some time now and decided to dedicate some weeks to something that always fascinated me: contributing to a big open source project. I started some smaller open source projects in the past (like Video4Linux.Net and ViGedit+) and contributed every so &hellip;

      Some weeks (even months) ago Dão Gottwald started the hunt for leaked DOMWindows and DocShells while running our browser-chrome mochitest suite (see bug 658738). That means that there are some expensive objects whose lifetimes are longer than they should be – they are kept alive until the test &hellip;

    <h2>Writing code for multi-process Firefox</h2>
    <p>
      You probably have all heard of this weird new thing called Electrolysis (a.k.a. e10s). Basically it’s all about running the browser UI and its tabs in separated processes. I recently rewrote a part of Panorama to be e10s-future-proof and thought I should share what I’ve learned so far… (If you don’ &hellip;

    <p>
      Starting with tomorrow’s Nightly hidden tabs are not anymore restored by default when starting Firefox. That means tabs from inactive Panorama groups will not load until these groups/tabs are shown. Finally we have a part of the behavior everyone actually expects when using Panorama. If you have &hellip;

    <h2>A Firefox Add-on</h2>
    <p>
      As you probably know, in Firefox there is unfortunately no way to configure existing shortcuts. All I found is the keyconfig add-on, that seems really old and very hard to configure (there is no UI, only about:config). That’s why I finally decided to write an add-on with a neat UI (not only) for &hellip;
