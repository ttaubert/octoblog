    <p>I got to spend Wednesday through Friday in Edinburgh last week to attend
<a href="http://www.scotlandjs.com/">Scotland.JS</a>. Edinburgh is a lovely city and I will
definitely return to get to know it better. It has great people, beers, food and
even a castle - what could one want more?</p>

<p>I arrived on Wednesday, just in time for the
<a href="http://techmeetup.co.uk/">TechMeetup</a>. It took place in the Appleton Tower and
had about 70-80 attendees with quite diverse technical backgrounds. I had a very
interesting talk to a freelance patent attorney and also met a couple of people
I knew from recent conferences and meetups in Berlin. After we were out of free
pizza and beers we met most of the Scotland.JS attendees in a pub right next to
the Appleton Tower. Cue more beers and tech conversations.</p>

<p>Thursday was the first day of Scotland.JS that started with
<a href="http://decadecity.net/blog/2013/05/09/jan-lehnardt-scotlandjs-opening-keynote">a great keynote</a>
from <a href="https://twitter.com/janl">Jan Lehnardt</a>. The most memorable talk of the
day was about
<a href="http://decadecity.net/blog/2013/05/09/philip-roberts-enemy-state-introduction-functional-reactive-programming-and-baconjs">Functional Reactive Programming using Bacon.js</a>
by <a href="https://twitter.com/philip_roberts">Philip Roberts</a>. There of course were a
lot more great talks but the possibilities of creating and combining event
streams kept my head spinning the most. At the end of the day we again went to a
neat pub near the venue and I headed to bed rather early, still a little tired
from travel and the day before.</p>

<p>Friday started with a short 20-minute walk through Edinburgh&rsquo;s old town that I
needed to pass on my way to the venue. My favorite talk of the second and last
day was held by <a href="https://twitter.com/dominictarr">Dominic Tarr</a> that tought us
about
<a href="http://decadecity.net/blog/2013/05/10/dominic-tarr-database-future-leveldb">the internals of leveldb</a>.
I also really enjoyed <a href="https://twitter.com/maboa">Mark Boas</a> talking about
<a href="http://happyworm.com/slides/scotlandjs2013/">making audio a first-class citizen of the web</a>
- a very entertaining and impressive mix of technologies. A GitHub drinkup in
the venue&rsquo;s own pub was a great way to end the conference - lots of good
conversations with Scotland.JS attendees and speakers as well as people from the
local tech community and visitors of the Scottish Ruby Conf.</p>

<p>I flew home the very next day and already miss Edinburgh with its neat little
alleys and pubs everywhere. The JavaScript community has once again shown its
value as a very interesting mix of nice welcoming people coming from so many
different technical backgrounds. Like after most conferences I feel a little
exhausted and my head is full of ideas for future or current (side-)projects. I
will try my best to return next year, it has been a lot of fun!</p>
